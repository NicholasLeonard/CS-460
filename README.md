# Toaster Code

## Motto

Delivering crisp slices of code

## Team Description

This is the repository for the Toaster Code development team. This repository houses all of our code for our Senior project as well as documents and files for each milestone we achieve

## Power Level Vision Statement

For people who want to get in shape or work out, the RPG-lite workout is a workout planning platform that integrates RPG elements into a workout plan. The web-app gives the user a workout plan customized and curated by them while providing a gamified interface and spin to all fitness activities that resembles a role playing game. Unlike other gamified applications, our product will both focus only on a fitness experience and provide the user with state recommend workouts in a fun, social format.

## Power Level Description

With this project, we aim to provide an RPG element to user's normal workout routine, which can help get their minds off of the workouts they are doing. We believe that working out is not fun for some individuals and we hope to change that. We hope to provide various workouts through dungeons that will earn you gear and experience for your character. Combined with proper workout tutorials for those unfamiliar with regular workout schedules and the ability to integrated your pre-existing fit-bit data, we hope to provide a fun and goal driven way to maintain your body while still meeting safety and national standards.
