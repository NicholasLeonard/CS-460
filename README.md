## Power Level Vision Statement

For people who want to get in shape or work out, the rpg-lite workout is a workout planning platform that integrates rpg elements into a workout plan. The webapp gives the user a workout plan customized and curatyed by them while providing a gamified interface and spin to all fitness activities that remsembles a role playing game. Unlike other gamified applications, our product will both focus only on a fitness expierence and provide the user with state reccommend workouts in a fun, social format.

## Power Level Description

With this project, we aim to provide an rpg element to user's normal workout routine, which can help get their minds off of the workouts they are doing. We believe that working out is not fun for some individuals and we hope to change that. We hope to provide various workouts through dungeons that will earn you gear and experience for your character. Combined with proper workout tutorials for those unfamiliar with regular workout schedules and the ability to integrated your pre-existing fit-bit data, we hope to provide a fun and goal driven way to maintain your body while still meeting safety and national standards.
